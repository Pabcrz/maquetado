            <h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Please read these Terms of Use (these "Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes
                access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our
                websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify
                Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, or other material that is made available through the Spotify
                Service (the "Content").
            </p>
            <p>
                Use of the Spotify Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, which
                are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
                agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
            </p>
            <h4>Service Provider</h4>
            <p>These Terms are between you and Spotify AB, Regeringsgatan 19, 111 53, Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
            <h4>Age and eligibility requirements</h4>
            <p>
                In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 13 years of age (or the
                equivalent minimum age in your home country) or older, (2) have parent or guardian consent if you are a
                minor in your home country, (3) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred
                from doing so under any applicable laws, and (4) reside in a country where the Service is available. You
                also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and
                complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times If you are a minor in your home country, your
                parent or guardian will need to enter into these Terms on your behalf. You can find additional
                information regarding minimum age requirements in the registration process. If you do not meet the
                minimum age requirements then Spotify will be unable to register you as a user.
            </p>
            <h2 id="2-service">2. The Spotify Service Provided by Us</h2>
            <h4>Spotify Service Options</h4>
            <p>
                We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided
                free-of-charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed (the "Paid
                Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including
                offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services
                provided by such third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to
                you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service,
                or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment
                details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service
                may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.
            </p>
            <h4>Trials</h4>
            <p>
                From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified
                period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you
                agree to the <a href="#">Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.</a>
            </p>
            <h4>Third-Party Applications, Devices and Open Source Software</h4>
            <p>
                The Spotify Service may be integrated with, or may otherwise interact with, third-party applications,
                websites, and services ("Third-Party Applications") and third-party personal computers, mobile handsets,
                tablets, wearable devices, speakers, and other devices ("Devices"). Your use of such Third-Party
                Applications and Devices may be subject to additional terms, conditions and policies provided to you by
                the applicable third party. Spotify does not guarantee that Third-Party Applications and Devices will be
                compatible with the Spotify Service.
            </p>
            <h4>Service Limitations and Modifications</h4>
            <p>
                We use reasonable care and skill to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a
                personalized, immersive audio experience. However, our service offerings and their availability may
                change from time to time and subject to applicable laws, without liability to you; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Spotify Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties,
                    maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and
                    regulatory requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We aim to evolve and improve our Services constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop
                    (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Spotify Service (including particular
                    functions, features, subscription plans and promotional offerings).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify
                    or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without
                    notice.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="3-yourUse">3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h2>
            <h4>Creating a Spotify account</h4>
            <p>
                You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and
                password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are
                responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our
                Customer Service team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe
                there has been unauthorized access to your account.
            </p>
            <p>Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.</p>
            <h4>Your rights to use the Spotify Service</h4>

                <u>Access to the Spotify Service</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject to your compliance with these Terms (including any other applicable terms and conditions), we
                grant to you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the
                Spotify Service and the Content (collectively, "Access"). This Access shall remain in effect unless and
                until terminated by you or Spotify. You agree that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify
                Service or the Content.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spotify software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold or transferred to you, and
                Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and
                Content even after installation on your Devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Spotify's Proprietary Rights</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. All Spotify
                trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand
